# DiscordBot(Work in Progress)

*Discord is a tool used for communication amongst friends*
A bot I created in python for my discord server, a fun mini project I made to mess with my friends on discord. Not only is it for 
fun purposes but it has a feature that will track the number of the people currently online, idle, and offline every hour and at the end of the day
it will send a graph to my email.
